# TenantIdentity

TenantIdentity is an open-source .NET library that combines **ASP.NET Core Identity** and **Entity Framework Core** with **multi-tenant management**.  
It provides a clean, extensible way to handle **user authentication**, **authorization**, and **multi-tenant data isolation** in modern SaaS applications.
